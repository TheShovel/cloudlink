# PROJECT DISCONTINUED
CL as it stands has been indefinitely discontinued. You are free to fork it and continue development as needed.

# SUCCESSOR IN DEVELOPMENT
[A far superior version of CloudLink is in development.](https://github.com/cloudlink-omega) Please consider giving it a try!

# Cloudlink
CloudLink is a free and open-source websocket solution optimized for Scratch.
Originally created as a cloud variables alternative, it can function as a multipurpose websocket framework for other projects.

# üç® Now in multiple flavors!
See ./python for the original Python-based server.
See ./golang for the WIP Go-based server.

# üêà A powerful extension for Scratch 3.0
You can learn about the protocol using the original Scratch 3.0 client extension.
Feel free to test-drive the extension in any of these Scratch mods:

- [PenguinMod](https://studio.penguinmod.com/editor.html?extension=https://extensions.penguinmod.com/extensions/MikeDev101/cloudlink.js) _(Click and run!)_
- [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/editor) _(You'll need to import the [extension code](https://mikedev101.github.io/cloudlink/scratch/cloudlink_turbowarp.js) as a file.)_
- [SheepTester's EÁæäicques](https://sheeptester.github.io/scratch-gui) _(You'll need to [inject](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-injector/edkcmfocepnifkbnbkmlcmegedeikdeb) the [extension code](https://mikedev101.github.io/cloudlink/scratch/cloudlink_epicques.js) manually.)_
